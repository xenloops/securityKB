# Communication Protocol Security Requirements

Secure communication is essential to protecting sensitive data and ensuring the reliable operation of medical devices. Each protocol has unique vulnerabilities and requires tailored measures to safeguard against threats. The following outlines security requirements common to all protocols, followed by specific considerations for individual communication methods.

## Common Requirements

All communication protocols must adhere to fundamental security principles, including encryption of transmitted data, robust authentication mechanisms, and regular monitoring for anomalies. Implement network segmentation and implement secure firmware updates to reduce attack surfaces.

* Ensure all protocols include encryption mechanisms for data in transit (e.g., TLS, AES).
* Integrate robust authentication frameworks into the device firmware or software.
* Incorporate logging and monitoring capabilities for anomaly detection.
* Design secure and verifiable firmware update systems.
* Enable and document network segmentation features in device configuration.
* Develop systems with built-in compliance to relevant standards (e.g., ISO 27001, FDA).

## Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy

Bluetooth and BLE protocols require strong pairing methods and discoverability. Both use the 2.4-GHz ISM band; BT can range up to 100 m, while BLE is typically limited to less than 50 m (indoors). These ranges can be intentionally limited for heightened security during pairing. Both can use encryption to protect data in transit.

* Implement secure pairing methods (e.g., numeric comparison, secure simple pairing) in firmware.
* Configure Bluetooth to remain undiscoverable by default, with an option to toggle only when required.
* Enforce BL/E-level encryption for all data exchanges by default.
* Develop software to allow control over device signal strength and range.
* Establish a schedule for updating Bluetooth drivers and libraries.

## WiFi

WiFi is a widely used wireless communication protocol that provides connectivity for devices over local networks. It enables high-speed data exchange and supports a broad range of applications, from simple device communication to complex IoT ecosystems. However, its reliance on radio waves makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping and unauthorized access, necessitating robust security measures like encryption and authentication.

* Enable WPA3 in device network configurations to ensure secure communication.
* Require and enforce strong passwords during configuration.
* Disable unnecessary services like WPS in the default device setup.
* Incorporate host-based firewalls to filter incoming and outgoing traffic.

## Cellular

Cellular communication leverages mobile networks to provide wide-area connectivity for devices, making it ideal for remote medical devices or applications requiring mobility. Cellular protocols offer built-in encryption and authentication mechanisms but may be susceptible to interception tools like IMSI catchers. Ensuring secure implementation is critical for protecting sensitive data transmitted over these networks.

* Work with cellular providers to ensure carrier-grade encryption is supported.
* Design devices to require SIM-based authentication for cellular access.
* Support VPN integration for secure data transmission.
* Test and secure roaming and fallback protocols to prevent downgrade attacks.
* Develop tools to track and alert unusual data consumption.

## Near-Field Communication (NFC)

NFC is a short-range protocol used for secure data exchange between devices in close proximity. Its low power requirements and convenience make it popular for applications such as contactless payments and device pairing. Despite its limited range, NFC is vulnerable to relay attacks and skimming, necessitating robust encryption and proximity-based access controls.

* Implement proximity verification in NFC transactions.
* Integrate encryption for NFC data exchanges in device firmware.
* Include timestamping or latency checks in NFC communication logic.
* Use secure elements or trusted hardware for storing sensitive NFC data.
* Provide option to disable NFC functionality via software and/or hardware when not needed.

## Wired Ethernet

Wired Ethernet provides high-speed, reliable communication through physical cables. It is less susceptible to wireless vulnerabilities like eavesdropping but requires physical security to protect against unauthorized access to network ports. Proper segmentation and monitoring are key to maintaining secure Ethernet networks.

* Ensure devices can support VLANs for network segmentation.
* Design features to block unauthorized Ethernet access (e.g., MAC address filtering).
* Include firewall configurations in the software interface.
* Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent ARP spoofing.
* Develop physical protections, such as tamper-resistant enclosures for Ethernet ports.

## Powerline Ethernet

Powerline Ethernet uses existing electrical wiring to transmit network signals, enabling connectivity in areas where traditional cabling is impractical. While it offers convenience and flexibility, it shares electrical circuits with other devices, creating potential security risks. Encryption and network isolation are essential to ensure secure data transmission.

* Include options for enabling encryption on Powerline communication adapters.
* Design devices to operate in isolated Powerline network environments.
* Provide tools for securely updating adapter firmware.
* Enable detection and alerts for unauthorized devices on the network.

## Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)

AMQP is a messaging protocol designed for secure, reliable, and efficient data exchange between distributed systems. It is widely used in IoT and cloud-based environments, where secure communication between brokers and clients is critical. Strong encryption and authentication measures are vital to prevent unauthorized access and ensure message integrity.

* Integrate secure authentication for all AMQP broker communications.
* Use TLS for encrypting AMQP messages by default.
* Implement role-based permissions for accessing queues.
* Design logging mechanisms for tracking message flows and access attempts.
* Configure AMQP brokers with hardened security settings as defaults.

## Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)

CoAP is a lightweight protocol optimized for resource-constrained devices. It enables efficient communication over UDP, making it suitable for low-power devices. Security is a key consideration, requiring measures like DTLS encryption and access control to mitigate vulnerabilities inherent to lightweight protocols.

* Use DTLS as the standard for encrypting CoAP messages.
* Build in mechanisms for verifying device identities during communication.
* Incorporate rate-limiting to defend against DoS attacks.
* Ensure the CoAP stack can be updated securely in response to vulnerabilities.

## Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)

MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol ideal for low-bandwidth or high-latency environments. Ensuring secure connections through TLS and robust access controls is essential to protect data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

* Include native support for SSL/TLS in MQTT communications.
* Develop fine-grained access controls for MQTT topics.
* Sanitize and control the use of retained messages to avoid persisting sensitive data.
* Provide logging and audit trails for all publish/subscribe events.

## Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

SPI is a high-speed communication protocol used for short-distance data exchange between microcontrollers and peripheral devices. Its simplicity and efficiency make it ideal for applications requiring fast, synchronous communication. Physical security and data integrity checks are necessary to protect against unauthorized access and signal manipulation.

* Include physical and logical protections against unauthorized connections.
* Add checksums or validation features for SPI data exchanges.
* Ensure SPI firmware updates are signed and verified.

## Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)

I2C is a widely used protocol for communication between low-speed peripherals and microcontrollers over short distances. Its shared bus architecture simplifies wiring but introduces weaknesse3s to unauthorized connections and signal interference. Device authentication and secure configurations are critical for mitigating these risks.

* Implement device authentication for all I2C-connected peripherals.
* Encrypt sensitive communication over shared buses.
* Preconfigure pull-up resistors to reduce tampering risks.
* Provide tools to monitor bus activity for suspicious behavior.

## Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)

UART is a serial communication protocol used for point-to-point data exchange between devices. It is commonly employed in embedded systems for its simplicity and reliability. However, UART's lack of built-in security features requires additional measures, such as physical protection and authentication, to safeguard against tampering and unauthorized access.

* Design enclosures to limit access to UART ports.
* Require device authentication for establishing UART communication.
* Implement parity checks or other mechanisms for data integrity.
* Support software or hardware-based isolation of UART communication channels.

These security requirements serve as a baseline for safeguarding communication protocols within and across devices. Each protocol's unique characteristics must be continuously assessed and updated to address emerging threats effectively.
