Database security is essential to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Understanding the fundamentals of securing databases is crucial to protect sensitive information and mitigate potential risks effectively. The main security controls protecting data are:

* Authentication
* Access control/authorization
* Encryption
* Logging and monitoring
* Audit
* Backup and recovery
* Continuous education

Authentication and authorization mechanisms play a vital role in database security. Enforce strong authentication practices, such as complex passwords and/or multi-factor authentication (MFA), to verify users' identities. 

Access control is a cornerstone of database security; authorization ensures that the correct users and systems can access only the data and functionality they are authorized for. Database Administrators (DBAs) must implement strict access controls by defining roles, permissions, and privileges based on the security Principle of Least Privilege. This means granting users and applications only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions.

Encryption is another fundamental control for securing data. Encryption mechanisms should be used to protect data both at rest (on disk) and in transit (over the network). [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_data_encryption) encrypts data files to prevent unauthorized access to data at rest. Using [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) encrypts data moving between the database server and client applications, safeguarding data from interception and/or manipulation by attackers.

Regular monitoring and auditing are essential for detecting and responding to security threats promptly. DBAs should implement [Database Activity Monitoring (DAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_activity_monitoring) tools to track database access, queries, and changes to data. Auditing database activities helps maintain accountability, identify suspicious behavior, and comply with regulatory requirements by generating audit trails and access logs.

Backup and recovery procedures are critical components of database security. DBAs should regularly back up database files and store backups securely to ensure data security and availability in case of disasters, data corruption, or ransomware attacks. Establishing comprehensive disaster recovery plans with defined recovery objectives and procedures enables quick restoration of databases in the event of data loss or system failures.

Lastly, DBAs should stay informed about the latest security vulnerabilities, patches, and best practices in database security. Regularly updating the database system and related software helps mitigate known vulnerabilities and strengthens overall security posture.

Securing databases requires a comprehensive approach that includes authentication, authorization/access control, encryption, logging and monitoring, auditing, backup and recovery, and training. By mastering these fundamentals, DBAs can effectively protect databases and sensitive data from security threats and ensure the integrity and availability of critical information assets.
