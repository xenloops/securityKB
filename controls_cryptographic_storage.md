# Cryptographic Storage

## Definitions
* Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) - an algorithm that generates apparently random numbers that might be predictable.
* Cryptographically-Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) - an algorithm that generates random numbers that may be used in cryptographic processes.

    Cryptographic Storage: General
  </summary>
  
  * Ensure all cryptographic modules fail securely and to handle errors properly.
  * Use a suitable random number generator.
  * Securely manage key access.

    Cryptographic Storage: Data Classification
  </summary>
  
  * Create a privacy impact assessment for every application to classify the data protection needs of any stored data correctly.
  * Store the following data encrypted while at rest:
    * Private data  (e.g. personally identifiable information (PII), sensitive personal information, data subject to the GDPR).
    * Protected Health Information (PHI) (e.g. medical records, medical device details, de-anonymized research records).
  * Financial data (e.g. financial accounts, defaults or credit history, tax records, pay history, beneficiaries, de-anonymized market or research records).

    Cryptographic Storage: Algorithms
  </summary>
  
  * **Never** use custom written cryptographic algorithms.
  * Ensure that cryptographic modules fail securely and errors are handled in a way that does not enable Padding Oracle attacks.
  * Use well vetted, industry proven, government-approved cryptographic algorithms, modes, and libraries.
  * Configure encryption initialization vector, cipher configuration, and block modes securely using the latest guidance.
  * Create applications such that random number, encryption or hashing algorithms, key lengths, rounds, ciphers, or modes 
  can be reconfigured, upgraded, or swapped at any time, to protect against cryptographic best-practice changes.
  * Avoid known insecure block modes (e.g. ECB), padding modes (e.g. PKCS#1 v1.5), ciphers with small block sizes (e.g. Triple-DES, Blowfish), 
  and weak hashing algorithms (e.g. MD5, SHA1). If required for backward compatibility, upgrade the obsolete system or use approved workarounds.
  * Use nonces, initialization vectors, and other single-use numbers only once with a given encryption key.
  * Generate nonces using a method appropriate for the algorithm used.
  * Verify encrypted data via signatures, authenticated cipher modes, or HMAC to ensure that ciphertext is not altered.
  * Ensure that all cryptographic operations are constant-time, with no 'short-circuit' operations in comparisons, calculations, or returns 
  to avoid leaking information.

    Cryptographic Storage: Randomization
  </summary>
  
  * Generate random values using the cryptographic module's approved cryptographically secure random number generator when these random values are intended to be not guessable.
  * Generate random GUIDs using the GUID v4 algorithm and a CSPRNG.
  * Generate random values with proper entropy even when the application is under heavy load.

    Cryptographic Storage: Secret Management
  </summary>
  
  * Use a secrets management solution such as a key vault to securely create, store, control access, to and destroy secrets.
  * Never expose key material to the application; instead use an isolated security module like a vault for cryptographic operations.
