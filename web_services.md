# Web Services

<details>
  <summary> General </summary>
  
* Ensure that adequate authentication, session management, and authorization of all web services are in place.
* Validate all parameters that transit from a lower to higher trust level.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Generic Web Service Security </summary>
  
* Use the same encodings and parsers across all application components to avoid parsing attacks that exploit different parsing behavior.
* Limit access to administration and management functions to authorized administrators.
* Verify API URLs do not expose sensitive information, such as the API key, session tokens etc.
* Make authorization decisions at the URI (enforced at the controller or router) and at the resource level (enforced by model-based permissions).
* Reject requests containing unexpected or missing content types with appropriate headers (HTTP response 406 Unacceptable or 415 Unsupported Media Type).
</details>

<details>
  <summary> RESTful Web Services </summary>
  
* Disable RESTful HTTP methods that are not valid for the user or action (e.g. DELETE or PUT on protected resources).
* Validate JSON schema before accepting.
* Protect RESTful web services that utilize cookies from Cross-Site Request Forgery via the use of at least one of the following: 
  * Triple or double submit cookie pattern
  * CSRF nonces
  * ORIGIN request header checks
* Use anti-automation controls for REST services to protect against excessive calls, especially if the API is unauthenticated.
* Confirm the incoming Content-Type is the expected one, such as application/xml or application/JSON.
* Verify that the message headers and payload are trustworthy and not modified in transit. 
* Require strong encryption for transport as it provides both confidentiality and integrity protection. 
* Use per-message digital signatures to provide additional assurance for high-security applications (but also have additional complexity).
</details>

<details>
  <summary> SOAP Web Service </summary>
  
* Validate XSD schema to ensure a properly formed XML document, followed by validation of each input field before any processing of the data.
* Sign message payloads using WS-Security to ensure reliable transport between client and service.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> GraphQL and other Web Service Data Layer </summary>
  
* Use query whitelisting or depth limiting and amount limiting to prevent GraphQL or data layer expression denial of service (DoS)
* Use query cost analysis for advanced scenarios.
* Use GraphQL or other data layer authorization logic at the business logic layer instead of the GraphQL layer.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Example security user stories </summary>
  
* As a user, I want the application to have adequate authentication, session management, and authorization on all web services that have access to my data.
