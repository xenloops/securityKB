# Privacy and Data Security

Protecting data is a core concern of information security.  Some information must be handled especially carefully, including:

* **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** such as government-issued ID number, birth date, etc. (anything that can uniquely identify a person)
* **Protected Health Information (PHI)** like health history, drug test results, physician notes, etc.
* **Intellectual Property (IP)**, including patent filings, project documentation, etc.

Privacy risks may have serious consequences for an organisation, including:
* Perceived and/or actual harm to privacy
* Failure to meet public expectations on the use and protection of personal information
* Costs of redesigning or retro-fitting systems
* Withdrawal of support from key supporting organisations
* Legal action by governmental regulators
* Compensation claims from individuals
* Increased insurance costs
