# Privacy Settings

Privacy settings on social media sites are often complex and confusing. The following are distilled down to the bare minimum settings to control (IMHO). Please [let me know](mailto:xenloops@protonmail.com?subject=Correction:privacy_social_media.md) if something looks outdated or incorrect -- personal privacy is so important these days! Please also [make requests](mailto:xenloops@protonmail.com?subject=Suggestion:privacy_social_media.md) for sites I haven't covered yet.

When reviewing the following settings, also check the information you divulge in your profile, especially:
* Name
* Date of birth
* Biography
* Location
* Contact information
* Links to your other social media profiles

All of this info can be used against you -- so it is vital to expose *only* what you really need to.

# Social media

Following are settings specific to various social media sites.

<details>
  <summary> LinkedIn </summary>

  To get to the appropriate settings, go to the Me menu > Settings & Privacy.

  ## Account preferences:
  ### Profile Information
  * Personal demographic information -- Check to ensure LI isn't storing your data (unless you trust Microsoft with it).
  ### General preferences
  *  Feed preferences > Show political content -- For sanity's sake, turn off (is this really where you want to see such dreg?)
  ### Syncing options
  * Sync contacts > Remove all -- Unless you trust Microsoft with them.
  * Partners & services -- Check that you really trust Microsoft with connecting to other services.

  ## Sign in & Security:
  ### Account access
  * Where you're signed in -- It doesn't hurt to check the active sessions list periodically. Make sure all the entries (usually one for each LI tab open) are yours. End any sessions you don't recognize. (I had sessions still open that I last accessed two months ago -- if anyone knows of a course in managing browser tabs, I'd like to hear about it.)
  * Two-step verification -- Turn on and use an authenticator app to make logging in more secure (and admittedly yes, slightly less convenient). Don't bother with SMS as a method, as this is susceptible to SIM swapping attacks.

  ## Visibility: 

  Change settings as desired. Of course, part of the point of LI is that people can find you and learn about your work history. But there are things you might not want to share, for example:
  ### Visibility of your profile & network
  * Who can see your email address (recommend limiting to connections or no one).
  * Who can see members you follow.
  * Page owners exporting your data (recommend turning off).
  * Profile discovery and visibility off LinkedIn (recommend turning off).
  
  ### Visibility of your LinkedIn activity
  * Manage active status (recommend setting to No one, unless you're ok with people seeing you're actively on LI).

  ## Data privacy:

  ### How LinkedIn uses your data
  Special thanks to the EU for passing the GDPR!
  * Get a copy of your data -- Not a bad idea to look through periodically.
  * Search history -- Only visible to LI, but if your search results aren't showing you what you want, it might be a good time to clear it here.
  * Demographic info -- This is sensitive info. Why give it to a company if it's not required?
  * Social, economic, and workplace research -- Turn off. You won't benefit from the collection of your data.
  * Data for Generative AI Improvement -- Turn off. You won't benefit from the collection of your data.

  ### Messaging experience
  * Read receipts and typing indicators -- Turn off.
  * Messaging suggestions -- Turn off, since this probably involves an AI reading and storing your messages.

  ### Job seeking preferences
  * Job application settings / Resumes and application data
    * Save resumes and application data -- Convenient, and as long as there's no sensitive data on your resume/CV beyond what's on your LI profile, not much of a risk.
    * Share resume data with recruiters -- See above.
    * Save self-ID information -- This is a bit more sensitive, so turn this off. It doesn't take much effort to answer the same three questions for each application (if you choose to).
  * Signal your interest to recruiters at companies you've created job alerts for -- Turn off (unless you want recruiters to know).

  ### Other applications
  * Permitted services -- Check periodically for services you didn't/no longer approve.
  * Microsoft Word -- Turn off. This is an ambiguous "connection" to help you write a resume using the "Resume Assistant" tool. The "Learn more" link doesn't work (as of 24 Sept 2024), so there's no easy way to tell where LI/Microsoft claims your data will be stored.

  ## Advertising data
  In general, turn this off. These are all settings relating to making LI money, and doesn't benefit you beyond targeted ads. Also, you have no idea where your LI data will be stored in advertisers' databases, or how it will be protected or for how long.

<details>
  <summary> Substack </summary>

  ## Privacy section

  Wonderfully simple privacy/security settings. To get to the appropriate settings, open the hamburger menu and scroll almost to the bottom to the page.
  
  * Show likes on profile -- if you're OK with your likes being public, leave on.
  * Allow mentions -- if you want other users to tag you publically, leave on.
  * Allow guest posts -- if you want to allow authors to list you as a co-author, leave on.

  ## Profile settings

  Some privacy settings hide in your profile. Get there by opening the hamburger menu and clicking on your user name, then click Edit profile.
  
  * Reads -- any Substacks you've subscribed to but don't want to appear publically, click off. You'll need to come back here anytime you add another Substack that you don't want to show on your profile.
  * Privacy -- if you don't want your likes to appear publically, click this off.

# Internet Service Providers

Following are settings specific to various ISPs.

<details>
  <summary> Xfinity / Comcast </summary>

  This one's pretty funny, if you have a dark sense of humor. On the main page, Xfinity states ""
  
  
  Keep in mind as you go through these pages -- they're **slow**. Xfinity clearly doesn't put load balancing on this server.

  To get to the appropriate settings, I'm including the direct URLs since navigating this company's privacy settings is a bit like avoiding the Minotaur in his labyrinth. These will route you through **two** pages on which you'll verify your contact information -- this does not appear to be security related, since you're able to change anything there.

The main link is [https://www.xfinity.com/privacy/your-privacy-choices](https://www.xfinity.com/privacy/your-privacy-choices).
  * [Sensitive personal information preferences](https://www.xfinity.com/privacy/requests/choice#Preferences)
    * Storage and usage of sensitive personal information: turn off.
  * Customer choices: click into and use the Turn off all button.
    * Sensitive personal information
    * Marketing and special offers: takes you to a 3rd party site mypreferences.com (run by something called PossibleNOW, Inc.), which would seem to contradict Xfinity's "we never sell" blurb. Turn these off if you don't want spam.
    * Calls, mail advertising, and in-person solicitations
  * Marketing and special offers
  * Communications from Xfinity: again, takes you to mypreferences.com. Sheesh, to opt-out of sales calls, info calls, junk mail, or door-to-door solicitations, you need to enter your personal info (which admittedly Xfinity already has, but you're giving it to PossibleNOW, Inc.) and check the box next to each.
  * [more to come]
