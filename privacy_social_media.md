# Social Media Privacy

Privacy settings on social media sites are often complex and confusing. The following are distilled down to the bare minimum settings to control (IMHO). Please [let me know](mailto:xenloops@protonmail.com?subject=Correction:privacy_social_media.md) if something looks outdated or incorrect -- personal privacy is so important these days!

When reviewing the following settings, also check the information you divulge in your profile, especially:
* Name
* Date of birth
* Biography
* Location
* Contact information
* Links to your other social media profiles

All of this info can be used against you -- so it is vital to expose *only* what you really need to.

  <summary> LinkedIn </summary>

  To get to the appropriate settings, go to the Me menu > Settings & Privacy.

  ## Account preferences:
  ### Profile Information
  * Personal demographic information -- Check to ensure LI isn't storing your data (unless you trust Microsoft with it).
  ### General preferences
  *  Feed preferences > Show political content -- For sanity's sake, turn off (is this really where you want to see such dreg?)
  ### Syncing options
  * Sync contacts > Remove all -- Unless you trust Microsoft with them.
  * Partners & services -- Check that you really trust Microsoft with connecting to other services.

  ## Sign in & Security:
  ### Account access
  * Where you're signed in -- It doesn't hurt to check the active sessions list periodically. Make sure all the entries (usually one for each LI tab open) are yours. End any sessions you don't recognize. (I had sessions still open that I last accessed two months ago -- if anyone knows of a course in managing browser tabs, I'd like to hear about it.)
  * Two-step verification -- Turn on and use an authenticator app to make logging in more secure (and admittedly yes, slightly less convenient). Don't bother with SMS as a method, as this is susceptible to SIM swapping attacks.

  ## Visibility: 

  Change settings as desired. Of course, part of the point of LI is that people can find you and learn about your work history. But there are things you might not want to share, for example:
  ### Visibility of your profile & network
  * Who can see your email address (recommend limiting to connections or no one).
  * Who can see members you follow.
  * Page owners exporting your data (recommend turning off).
  * Profile discovery and visibility off LinkedIn (recommend turning off).
  
  ### Visibility of your LinkedIn activity
  * Manage active status (recommend setting to No one, unless you're ok with people seeing you're actively on LI).

  ## Data privacy:

  ### How LinkedIn uses your data
  Special thanks to the EU for passing the GDPR!
  * Get a copy of your data -- Not a bad idea to look through periodically.
  * Search history -- Only visible to LI, but if your search results aren't showing you what you want, it might be a good time to clear it here.
  * Demographic info -- This is sensitive info. Why give it to a company if it's not required?
  * Social, economic, and workplace research -- Turn off. You won't benefit from the collection of your data.
  * Data for Generative AI Improvement -- Turn off. You won't benefit from the collection of your data.

  ### Messaging experience
  * Read receipts and typing indicators -- Turn off.
  * Messaging suggestions -- Turn off, since this probably involves an AI reading and storing your messages.

  ### Job seeking preferences
  * Job application settings / Resumes and application data
    * Save resumes and application data -- Convenient, and as long as there's no sensitive data on your resume/CV beyond what's on your LI profile, not much of a risk.
    * Share resume data with recruiters -- See above.
    * Save self-ID information -- This is a bit more sensitive, so turn this off. It doesn't take much effort to answer the same three questions for each application (if you choose to).
  * Signal your interest to recruiters at companies you've created job alerts for -- Turn off (unless you want recruiters to know).

  ### Other applications
  * Permitted services -- Check periodically for services you didn't/no longer approve.
  * Microsoft Word -- Turn off. This is an ambiguous "connection" to help you write a resume using the "Resume Assistant" tool. The "Learn more" link doesn't work (as of 24 Sept 2024), so there's no easy way to tell where LI/Microsoft claims your data will be stored.

  ## Advertising data
  In general, turn this off. These are all settings relating to making LI money, and doesn't benefit you beyond targeted ads. Also, you have no idea where your LI data will be stored in advertisers' databases, or how it will be protected or for how long.

  <summary> Substack </summary>

  Wonderfully simple privacy/security settings. To get to the appropriate settings, open the hamburger menu and scroll almost to the bottom to the page.
  
  ## Privacy section

  * Show likes on profile -- if you're OK with your likes being public, leave on.
  * Allow mentions -- if you want other users to tag you publically, leave on.
  * Allow guest posts -- if you want to allow authors to list you as a co-author, leave on.

  Some privacy settings hide in your profile. Get there by opening the hamburger menu and clicking on your user name, then click Edit profile.
  
  * Reads -- any Substacks you've subscribed to but don't want to appear publically, click off.
  * Privacy -- if you don't want your likes to appear publically, click this off.
