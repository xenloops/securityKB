# About the tool

Veracode Fix is a remediation solution that helps development teams to get AI/LLM-generated code patches, review the suggested patches, and apply them directly to flaws in their source code without writing any code themselves.

## Limitations

Veracode Fix resolves findings found by Pipeline Scan, but doesn't resolve findings found by Upload and Scan.
