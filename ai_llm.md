# Artificial Intelligence / Large Language Model Security

AI and LLMs have revolutionized various industries by providing advanced capabilities such as natural language understanding, predictive analysis, and decision support. However, the increasing integration of AI/LLM technologies into critical systems has also heightened concerns about their security. Securing these systems is essential to protect sensitive data, ensure trust, and maintain the reliability and integrity of AI-driven applications.

The following outlines key security requirements for AI/LLM systems, providing a foundation for mitigating risks and safeguarding these technologies. Fortunately, many of the controls that apply to AI are the same controls in use for decades to secure applications.

## Access controls

* Enforce strict user authentication and access controls to prevent unauthorized interactions with the AI/LLM system. This reduces the risk of misuse or exposure to malicious actors.
* Safeguard APIs used to interact with LLMs by implementing HTTPS protocols, API keys, rate limiting, and activity logging to prevent abuse or unauthorized access.

## Data controls

* Many AI/LLM systems process sensitive data during training and inference. It is crucial to ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) by implementing robust data anonymization, encryption, and access controls.
* Maintain a clear record of the data used for training and the decisions made by the LLM to support traceability, accountability, and debugging in the event of issues.
* Implement mechanisms to sanitize and validate outputs to prevent the dissemination of harmful, biased, or sensitive information generated by the model.
* Ensure that the LLM adheres to ethical standards by minimizing biases, preventing harm, and avoiding outputs that could lead to legal or reputational issues.

## System Integrity

* Protect the LLM from unauthorized modifications or adversarial attacks that could compromise its behavior. Use cryptographic hashing and verification techniques to maintain the integrity of the model files.
* Secure the runtime environment where the LLM is deployed. This includes containerization, network segmentation, and regular updates to prevent vulnerabilities in underlying infrastructure.
* Use encryption and digital rights management when sharing models or collaborating across organizations to prevent unauthorized use or tampering.
* Deploy defenses such as query rate limits and response obfuscation to prevent attackers from reconstructing the LLM through repeated queries.

## Monitoring

* Employ systems to monitor for unusual activities or anomalies during LLM operation. This can include detecting abnormal request patterns or unexpected model outputs.

## Conclusion

Addressing these security requirements ensures that AI/LLM systems remain trustworthy and resilient against evolving threats. As these technologies continue to advance, ongoing vigilance and updates to security practices are essential to mitigate emerging risks and maintain user confidence.
