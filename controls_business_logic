# Business Logic
Business logic security must be designed into a system and cannot be added using web application firewalls or other controls after the fact. 
Threat modeling during the design sprints assists greatly in this process.

    Business Logic: General
  </summary>
  
  * Ensure business logic flows are sequential, processed in order, and cannot be bypassed.
  * Include limits in Business logic to detect and prevent automated attacks.
  * For high value business logic flows, create abuse cases.
  * Protect against major kinds of attacks, including:
    * Spoofing
    * Tampering
    * Repudiation
    * Information disclosure
    * Denial of service
    * Elevation of privilege
  * Process business logic flows for the same user in sequential step order and without allowing skipped steps.
  * Process business logic flows with all steps being processed in realistic human time, i.e. transactions are not submitted too quickly.
  * Include appropriate limits for specific business actions or transactions appropriately enforced on a per-user basis.
  * Use anti-automation controls sufficient to detect and protect against data exfiltration, excessive business logic requests, excessive file uploads, or denial of service attacks.
  * Use business logic limits or validation to protect against likely business risks or threats, identified using threat modeling or similar methodologies.
  * Test for "time of check to time of use" (TOCTOU) issues or other race conditions for sensitive operations.
  * Monitor for unusual events or activity from a business logic perspective (e.g. attempts to perform actions out of order or actions which a legitimate user would never attempt).
  * Design in configurable alerting for when automated attacks or unusual activity is detected.
